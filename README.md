This is an Android app derived from the [Torque Plugin Sample](http://torque-bhp.com/), combined with a Bluetooth server that can send OBD data to a client (e.g. Google Glass).

Currently, only one of the OBD parameters is being sent (RPM).   A companion project [Glass OBD HUD](https://github.com/mpicco/glass-obd-hud) is a Google Glass app that displays it on Glass.

The plan is to send Speed, RPM, Gear Position and Throttle Position and render it 10x second on Google Glass.

Tested for over 45 minutes on my ride home tonight and it worked great.  I'll be adding the other parameters in the next day or so.
